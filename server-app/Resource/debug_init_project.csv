Food shortages due to COVID-19,"Countries all over the world have been affected by COVID-19 related lockdowns, travel restrictions, severe disruptions to their health systems and food shortages, but the impact of the pandemic has been felt the most in areas of the world that were already struggling.","Countries all over the world have been affected by COVID-19 related lockdowns, travel restrictions, severe disruptions to their health systems and food shortages, but the impact of the pandemic has been felt the most in areas of the world that were already struggling.
Parts of Africa are suffering from a threefold crisis:
1. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (including lack of access to effective vaccination programmes).
2. Climate-related disasters such as drought and cyclones.
3. Economic downturn and high unemployment rates.
In Sudan, a spiralling economic crisis, caused by pandemic related job losses, rising inflation and sky-high food prices, is having a devastating impact on families. In a country where conflict and localised violence had already led to 1.9 million people being internally displaced, now with COVID-19 compounding the situation, more than 1.1 million children are going hungry.
XXX, cited as the world’s ‘worst humanitarian crisis by the United Nations, has 20.1 million citizens facing hunger and 50% of these are severely food insecure. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the years of civil war that have ravaged the country and disrupted the supply of humanitarian aid that the people of Yemen rely on."
Malnutrition due to COVID-19,"The XXX report by Save The Children, examines child malnutrition in the world today and what they refer to as the ‘complex and devastating’ effect of COVID-19. ","The XXX report by Save The Children, examines child malnutrition in the world today and what they refer to as the ‘complex and devastating’ effect of COVID-19. Their in-depth analysis suggests that without immediate action, a further 9.3 million children will be wasted by 2022, with two-thirds of cases being in South Asia.
They highlight not only the inequity that exists globally around access to nutrition； but also the disproportionate impact this has on women and girls.
Many of the countries where people suffer from acute food shortages are heavily reliant on foreign aid. If you are able to donate money to a reputable charity that is providing necessary food, shelter and medicine to these people this can usually be done quickly and easily online. UK taxpayers can also boost their donations by 25p for each pound if they donate through it.
Elsewhere, as a consumer, if you are able to, it is always better to buy items. For shoppers, purchasing Fairtrade items means better quality and more ethical products as in order for an item to have Fairtrade certification, certain standards must be met to ensure fair pricing and better conditions for food industry workers abroad including fair pay and safer working conditions.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes and challenges that have been felt around the world, with even the richest countries struggling to keep their citizens safe and the health situation under control.
It has also put under scrutiny the very real threat of food insecurity that millions of people have to live with in the developing world and given pause for thought to many in the West about what they eat, how they shop and their expectations around immediate access to food."
Impact of food shortages,"In 2019, an estimated 135 million people faced life-threatening food insecurity, according to the World Food Program (WFP), the UN food assistance agency.","In 2019, an estimated 135 million people faced life-threatening food insecurity, according to the World Food Program (WFP), the UN food assistance agency. Now, that number is projected to nearly double due to the coronavirus pandemic, with food emergencies afflicting countries that have not required interventions in the past.

Pandemic restrictions have made it more difficult to access food, and economic downturns around the globe could mean long-lasting inability to afford food for hundreds of millions of people. The hunger crisis will have dramatic implications in many areas. It threatens to unravel decades of progress in global health: poor diets are the leading contributor to the world’s disease burden, including childhood conditions such as stunting and chronic illnesses caused in part by obesity. Hunger, both acute and chronic, can also impede children’s education and career prospects. In extreme cases, it can roil the political landscape. Surging food prices helped fuel recent protests in Lebanon, while shortages led to demonstrations in Chile earlier this year. Many without access to food flee home in search of it; the WFP estimates that for every 1 per cent increase in hunger, there is a 2 per cent increase in migration."
Addressing hunger is critical,"Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we also need long-lasting solutions. That's why we work with countries around the world to help vulnerable people everywhere get the food they need to survive and thrive. ","Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we also need long-lasting solutions.

Our programmers go beyond traditional aid models to beat hunger in innovative ways. Increasingly, we send cash directly to hungry families because they’re the ones who know best how to end their hunger for good.

When people make their own food choices, it also means they buy locally and their community benefits too. "
Food assistance thus becomes part of a policy mix ,"Since the late 2000s, a strategic rethink has seen the XXX shift from the concept of food aid to that of food assistance.","Since the late 2000s, a strategic rethink has seen the XXX shift from the concept of food aid to that of food assistance.

While food aid is a tried and tested model, proudly woven into XXX history, it sprang from a largely unidirectional, top-down vision: people were hungry; we fed them. Food assistance, by contrast, involves a more complex understanding of people’s long-term nutritional needs and of the diverse approaches required to meet them. This conceptual shift has been at the core of XXX’s transformation in recent years. While we remain the world’s leading humanitarian agency, we have evolved to combine frontline action with the quest for durable solutions.

This shift is about recognizing that hunger does not occur in a vacuum. It means we must concentrate time, resources and efforts on the most vulnerable in society. It implies not just emergency interventions, but tailored, multi-year support programmes designed to lift a whole nation’s nutritional indicators. We balance the urgency to alleviate hunger here and now with the broader objective of ending hunger once and for all.

Food assistance thus becomes part of a policy mix that advances social wellbeing in general. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, and in particular with Goal 2, we consider the quality as well as the quantity of food, with the emphasis on its nutritious character and seasonality. Crucially, food assistance enlists beneficiaries as actors: it gives them a voice, and, wherever possible, a choice in what food they receive and how they receive it.

This last principle has been steadily gaining prominence. And it helps explain why over the last decade, in-kind food assistance (the only type there was until the mid-2000s) has partly given way to cash-based transfers.

“Cash” for XXX involves physical banknotes, vouchers, or electronic funds being given to beneficiaries to spend directly. Empowering people to meet their essential needs is a long-haul process. From 10 million USD transferred in 2009 to 2.1 billion in 2019, cash now represents over a third of all XXX assistance. With its benefits of flexibility, efficiency and beneficiary choice, cash is growing rapidly within our hunger-fighting portfolio. In fact, both cash and in-kind are likely to co-exist for the foreseeable future, with XXX increasingly adept at using them singly, alternately or jointly in any given setting.

Our work is to deliver long-term aid that creates lasting change for children as well as addressing children’s immediate needs.

When you set up a regular donation to XXX, you become part of that long-term work to keep the world’s most vulnerable children safe. For example, by donating £16.50 each month, you could help XXX equip health workers with vaccine cold boxes to make sure that the life-saving vaccines against diseases like polio, whooping cough and measles are kept cool enough to remain effective. This means that children in even the most remote places can be safe from disease.

Alternatively, a monthly donation of £30 from you could provide all the equipment and medicine that a midwife needs to deliver more than 12 babies safely, giving both mother and child the best start."

We’re there for families right from the beginning. We support expecting mothers to have a safe pregnancy, so they give birth to healthy babies and we support the provision of healthcare and essential micronutrients throughout childhood. In places like Liberia, we’ve helped mothers in remote locations get a better understanding of child health and nutrition, so they can go on to inform and strengthen their own communities."
Prevent all forms of malnutrition,Prevent all forms of malnutrition,"XXX works to prevent all forms of malnutrition by improving children’s and women’s access to nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable diets. Since 1990, the percentage of undernourished children worldwide has almost halved. But we still have a lot of work to do. Today about 200 million children’s lives are at risk because they are malnourished — almost twice as many suffer from deficiencies in vitamins and other essential micronutrients."

What are the main causes of famine?,"Conflict is the biggest driver of famine. Hunger levels worsen when conflict drives large numbers of people from their homes, their land and their jobs.","There are many problems which contribute to famine.

Conflict is the biggest driver of famine. Hunger levels worsen when conflict drives large numbers of people from their homes, their land and their jobs. Famines tend to occur in areas where access is restricted, a common factor in conflict zones.

Climate change and more regular droughts are increasing food shortages. Drought means fewer crops, and climate-induced migration is driving farmers from their land.

The fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic is contributing to sharply increasing hunger numbers. Measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 have hit economies worldwide, pushing millions into unemployment and poverty, and leaving governments and donors with fewer resources to address the food and nutritional needs of the most vulnerable people.

Inequality is also a critical factor, with low incomes putting affordable food beyond the reach of millions."
Where is there famine in the world?,"There are no countries in the world currently meeting the official definition of a famine outlined above, but there are many countries where the risk of starvation is real and famine could happen very soon.","There are no countries in the world currently meeting the official definition of a famine outlined above, but there are many countries where the risk of starvation is real and famine could happen very soon.

While the majority of affected people live in countries in Africa, the risk of famine is global. Acute hunger is set to rise steeply in most world regions, from the Middle East to Latin America and the Caribbean.

Famines tend to occur in areas where humanitarian access is restricted. In Yemen and South Sudan in particular, conflict, insecurity and resulting displacement are driving acute hunger to alarming levels.

As well as in those two countries, people in the northern parts of Ethiopia and Nigeria are also at particular risk, according to the Hunger Hotspots report, published jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. 

Globally, 44 million people in 38 countries are currently on the very edge of famine and risk starvation, up from 27 million people in 2019.

Households with any children and larger families more likely to need support,The last year has seen consistent challenges to XXX government on levels of child poverty and the figures released today again highlight this issue. ,"The last year has seen consistent challenges to XXX government on levels of child poverty and the figures released today again highlight this issue. One in four (24%) people living with children were food insecure, compared to 12% in households without children. People living with children were almost twice as likely to report needing support from a food bank than households without children (11% vs 6%).  

Larger households were also more at risk of being food insecure. A quarter (24%) of households with five or more people were food insecure. This is more than twice the rate of households of two people (11%). These households were also more likely to report needing support from a food bank (11% vs 6% of households of two people).  

This is consistent with what we find in food banks in the Trussell Trust network. Parcels provided to children made up 39% of the support provided by food banks in 2020/21 were children, even though children make up only 20% of the UK population. Further, among families with children referred to a food bank in early 2020, nearly two in five (39%) had three or more children. This is nearly three times the rate in the general population, where just 14% of families with children have three or more children."
Support of Food Bank,"In today’s instalment of the State of Hunger (2021) blog series, we are looking at the impact of the XXX condition on people who are forced to turn to food banks for support","In today’s instalment of the State of Hunger (2021) blog series, we are looking at the impact of the XXX condition on people who are forced to turn to food banks for support. 

 The XXX condition prevents a person subject to immigration control from accessing a range of welfare benefits except in a very limited number of cases.

This condition means many people with XXX are forced to use food banks. Before the pandemic, 2 to 4% of people referred to food banks were likely subject to the XXX condition, which rose to 11% in mid-2020. 

State of Hunger 2021 shows that 95% of people referred to food banks in the Trussell Trust network are experiencing destitution, a level of poverty which means they cannot meet all of their basic needs like food, heating and shelter.

While government legislation officially allows people with XXX to be exempted from the condition if they are destitute or at imminent risk of destitution, our data shows that many destitute people with XXX are still not getting the support they need, and are forced to food banks as a result. 

The issues in the current system were highlighted starkly during the XXX discussion by panelists including Ealing Foodbank Manger Janet Fletcher. Janet explained how the food bank was seeing high numbers of people with XXX coming to them for support, particularly since the pandemic hit, and that people feel the system is stacked to make them fail. 

People with XXX coming to the food bank also told Janet how much they wanted to be able to give to society, but the present barriers in place prevented them making the full contribution they could, as well as stopping them from having adequate financial support to afford the essentials.   

Why has need increased particularly among people with XXX during the pandemic? Evidence suggests that people with XXX were particularly exposed to income shocks from the economic impact of the pandemic.

People with XXX are more likely to be self-employed and/or in informal, casual and low-paid types of employment. These forms of employment have been particularly hard hit during the pandemic and those with XXX have not been able to access government support. Due to the low-paid and precarious nature of their employment, many people with XXX also have low levels of savings, making it harder to weather the financial shock of lost earnings. 

However, the issue of XXX and food bank use is not a new one arising solely from the pandemic’s economic impact. State of Hunger 2021 shows that, before the pandemic, almost two in five referral agencies (38%) and a quarter (25%) of food bank managers said that the restricted access to public funds experienced by migrants and refugees had a very high impact on the need for food banks.

They also highlighted the impact of people with XXX being denied access to local support services, with 31% of referral agencies and 10% of food bank managers saying that the limited or restricted access to local support services (such as welfare advice, debt advice, homelessness services etc.) had a very high impact on food bank need for this group. 

What can be done to prevent people with XXX from needing to use food banks? The UK government has a major role to play in tackling this problem.

The government should work to increase the accessibility of Local Welfare Assistance Schemes to people in crisis who are subject to XXX, building on the work local authorities have done during the pandemic. The government can learn from the work of local authorities and its own actions during the pandemic, such as the welcome choice to expand access to crisis support to people subject to XXX through the Covid Local Support Grant, to ensure that, going forwards, support through XXX is accessible. 

 It’s not right that anyone in our society experiences destitution, and as an absolute minimum, the government must make it easier for people experiencing destitution to have the XXX condition lifted so that they can access the support they need. "
2022 is going to be a bad year for world hunger,How climate action can make a difference,"Today, the UN World Food Programmer’s live Hunger Map aggregates 957 million people across 93 countries who do not have enough to eat. The Global Humanitarian Outlook projects 239 million people are in need of life-saving humanitarian action and protection this year.

Of the factors driving global hunger, the climate is the one that can best be predicted using science. Our technical abilities to monitor and forecast weather-related hazards have never been as good as today. There is no ethically justified reason to keep treating climate disasters as inevitable and ‘natural’ surprises. As countries are re-grouping to think about ways in which the COVID-19 crisis can be used as a springboard to build more resilient societies, climate foresight and preventive planning need to be part of the equation.

Many countries have started to recognize the global climate emergency as a humanitarian issue. Climate change fuels conflict and economic risks, while compounding the effects of disease outbreaks. Like COVID-19, it is highly globalized and dynamic, and cannot be contained by one country, one institution or one academic discipline. It requires countries and organizations to work together to identify and implement solutions. Some of these solutions are emerging from new angles and directions, for example as part of a new global dialogue about food systems. XXX’s involvement includes anchoring the Resilience Action Track of the 2021 Food Systems Summit to discuss game-changing approaches for the transformation of imperiled and unsustainable food systems."
Children’s food insecurity increasing during COVID-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic is driving up food insecurity among children nationwide, according to experts from XXX.","The coronavirus pandemic is driving up food insecurity among children nationwide, according to experts from XXX.

In an October 28, 2020 USA Today op-ed, four Harvard Chan School faculty members noted that the per cent of U.S. households with children who are food insecure has doubled, from 14% to 28%, with communities of colour most affected. An additional 2.5 million children have fallen below the poverty line since May. Every day, 14 million children are going hungry, they wrote.

Co-authors included Joseph Allen, associate professor of exposure assessment science; Sara Bleich, professor of public health policy; Jessica Cohen, Bruce A. Beal, Robert L. Beal, and Alexander S. Beal Associate Professor of Global Health; and Benjamin Sommers, Huntley Quelch Professor of Health Care Economics.

With many schools closed for in-person learning—limiting children’s access to free or reduced-price meals—and high unemployment, children’s food insecurity has grown to the highest level in decades, according to the authors. And while schools and cities are making efforts to provide meals for children at locations such as apartment buildings or along school bus routes, more needs to be done, they say.

The authors recommended that the federal safety net be strengthened—for example, by increasing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Noting that the Senate has so far failed to take up House legislation calling for a temporary increase in SNAP benefits and other funding to provide child nutrition assistance, they wrote, “It should be a national outrage that 14 million children are hungry in America. If we do not act swiftly, food insecurity will harm a generation of children, especially Black and brown children.”

What can (still) be done,"As outlined in last year’s report, transforming food systems is essential to achieve food security, improve nutrition and put healthy diets within reach of all. This year’s edition goes further to outline six “transformation pathways”.","As outlined in last year’s report, transforming food systems is essential to achieve food security, improve nutrition and put healthy diets within reach of all. This year’s edition goes further to outline six “transformation pathways”. These, the authors say, rely on a “coherent set of policy and investment portfolios” to counteract the hunger and malnutrition drivers.

Depending on the particular driver (or combination of drivers) confronting each country, the report urges policymakers to:

Integrate humanitarian, development and peacebuilding policies in conflict areas – for example, through social protection measures to prevent families from selling meagre assets in exchange for food;
Scale-up climate resilience across food systems – for example, by offering smallholder farmers wide access to climate risk insurance and forecast-based financing;
Strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable to economic adversity – for example, through in-kind or cash support programmes to lessen the impact of pandemic-style shocks or food price volatility;
Intervene along supply chains to lower the cost of nutritious foods – for example, by encouraging the planting of biofortified crops or making it easier for fruit and vegetable growers to access markets;
Tackle poverty and structural inequalities – for example, by boosting food value chains in poor communities through technology transfers and certification programmes;
Strengthen food environments and changing consumer behavior – for example, by eliminating industrial trans fats and reducing the salt and sugar content in the food supply, or protecting children from the negative impact of food marketing.
The report also calls for an “enabling environment of governance mechanisms and institutions” to make transformation possible. It enjoins policymakers to consult widely; to empower women and youth; and to expand the availability of data and new technologies. Above all, the authors urge, the world must act now – or watch the drivers of hunger and malnutrition recur with growing intensity in coming years, long after the shock of the pandemic has passed."

Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. ","Even before XXX launched a war in XXX, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.
The number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the XXX said this month.
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.
Global wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They're expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst XXX.
The wheat planting season, which is about to begin in XXX, will be disrupted by fighting. It's not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they'll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.
""It's anyone's guess if XXX will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,"" XXX said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.
Getting products from XXX onto the world market has also gotten more difficult because businesses don't want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of travelling near a war zone.
XXX and XXX serve as the breadbasket for countries in the XXX and XXX that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. XXX and XXX will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.
""Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,"" the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.
